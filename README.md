# CSS/SVG
## Objective

The objective is to create this identical animation using CSS animations instead of JavaScript that has the ability to be both responsive and used cross-browser.

## Directions

Clone this repo and open index.html to see the desired final animation. Currently this uses an SVG and is animated through an SVG JavaScript plugin: https://github.com/callmenick/Draw-Fill-SVG. 
1. `js/modernizr.js` is something that Draw Fill SVG requires.
2. `js/svgdrawfill.js` is the JS SVG animation plugin. 
3. `index.html` contains an SVG. The SVG element has an id of `svg` for `svgdrawfill.js` to target. 
4. Refer to https://github.com/callmenick/Draw-Fill-SVG to understand how the animation is created.
